# Tuscany

A little retro text adventure based on the song The Count of Tuscany by Dream Theater.

This game requires my [textadventure](https://github.com/flipcoder/textadventure)
library to work.  So make sure to copy or symlink textadventure.py from that into this folder.

This game optionally syncs with the 8-bit version of Count of Tuscany here:

If you want music, download it using a youtube-to-mp3 converter.
Name it "tuscany.mp3", and put it in the same folder.

Thanks to https://reddit.com/r/DreamTheater for the feedback and liking this idea!
